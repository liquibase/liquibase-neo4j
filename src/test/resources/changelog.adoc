= Awesome project

Here is a great data migration:

[source,cypher,id=initial-data,author=fbiville]
----
CREATE (:Foo {name: "fighters"})
----

And another one:

[source,cypher,id=more-data,author=fbiville]
----
CREATE (:Bar {name: "tender"})
----

But not this one:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM foobar
----
